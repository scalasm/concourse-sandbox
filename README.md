# Concourse CI sandbox

Hi this is my personal [Concourse CI](https://concourse-ci.org/) sandbox, collecting spikes and recipes that I may find useful across different contexts :)

Pipelines are in [this folder](./pipelines/) .

You can start local Concourse serve using docker compose:
```bash
docker compose up
```
